# New OpenshiftIO app On-boarding

Main Ref: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rKA_Uxve5f_mFNK4vhKhXrMcquiy25AQ5tpHJQwtbc/edit#heading=h.2r3a4udhggjl

## Steps in brief:

1. Create a github org and a repo under it with desired code.

2. The repo should have:
    ** Elegant build-able Dockerfile(as per best docker practices)
    ** Shell scripts to:
        *** Set build ENV for Jenkins slave

            Ref:
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/cico_build_deploy.sh
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/cico_setup.sh

        *** Test the app

            Ref:
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/cico_run_tests.sh
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/run_tests.sh

        *** Wrapper around Code syntactic and semantic validation scripts. ex: Linter scripts

            Ref:
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/cico_run_eslint.sh
                https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/run_eslint.sh

    ** OC resource templates to describe deployment on oc cluster

       Ref:
           https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/openshift/template.yaml

    ** Script to automate deployment of resources in above mentioned OC templates on openshift cluster

       Ref:
           https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor/blob/master/openshift/deploy.sh

  Verify the app on local minishift cluster.

  For detailed installation steps please refer: INSTALL.md of https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/supervisor

3. The app should have integration with ci.centos.org for image builds and image to be stored in centos registry.

  Ref:
      https://github.com/CentOS/container-index#quickstart

4. For the scripts in step 2 above to be invoked by the dev-tools maintained Jenkins infra for:
    ** Building the app's docker image
    ** Run UTs
    ** Push image to registry on UT validation
    ** Deploy the image to stage cluster as container/s
   One needs to add job configuration specific to the new app as described in https://github.com/almighty/almighty-jobs/blob/master/README.adoc

5. At this stage, the service delivery team can be requested to either provide a dedicated saas git repo or (review of) an entry in the saas-openshiftio
   Hereafter, service delivery team ticket can be raised to on-board the new app.

   Ref:
    1. https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/dtsd/housekeeping/issues/974
    2. https://github.com/openshiftio/saasherder/blob/master/README.md
       a. Dedicated repo: https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/saas-hdd/pull/1
       b. Entry in saas-openshifio --
          https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-openshiftio/blob/master/dsaas-services/fabric8-ui.yaml

   Note: The service delivery team does an annual shut down around mid december(20th Dec) when no new services can be added
