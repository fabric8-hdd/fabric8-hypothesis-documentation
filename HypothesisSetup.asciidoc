# Building the fabric8-hypothesis-manager-api-image image

1. First make sure that you have built and pushed the nodejs images (built from fabric8-hypothesis-core-image) with the approriate default node version, npm version, push registry, pull registry, organisation and port values. It acts as the base layer for other images.
2. Fork this repo: https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-manager-api-image.git
* For changing the app_name, change the APP_NAME value in the app_constants.sh file, this will chnage the image name.
* For changing the port, route_path, route_prefix and hostname, change the respective values in the supervisor.env file in the openshift folder.
NOTE: Changes to supervisor.env will be affected only for deployments using openshift/deploy.sh and will not be applicable for the default osio CI/CD and the port as a parameter needs to be changed at the time of image build as well as the port exposed for service will be exposed at image build time itself.
