This repository is intended as the single source of information related to Hypothesis stack.
Accordingly, following details are available in this repository:

[Architecture](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/HypothesisArchitecture.asciidoc): This document provides a brief overview of the purpose and architecture of Hypothesis stack.

[Development Environment Setup](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/DevEnvironmentSetup.asciidoc): This document provides a walkthrough of key components to be setup for git, nodejs, docker and minishift.

[Hypothesis Stack Setup](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/HypothesisSetup.asciidoc): This document provides a brief overview of how the images for the components of hypothesis stack can be built and deployed for local testing.

[Hypothesis Repository WalkThrough](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/Fabric8HypothesisRepoWalkthorugh.asciidoc): This document adds an overview of the components of different repositories of hypothesis stack along with an brief overview of the purpose of different repos in the hypothesis stack.

[Fabric8 Service On-boarding](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/AppOnBoarding.asciidoc): This document adds details required for on-boarding a new service onto OSIO.

[Fabric8 Hypothesis CI/CD Process](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/HypothesisCICD.asciidoc): This document adds details around the CI/CD procedure employed by Hypothesis stack components and the different tests run at each stage from a pull request to merge on master to deployment on stage to promotion top prod.

[OS Parametrisation](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/OsParameterisation.asciidoc): This document describes the procedure to be employed if hypothesis stack components are required to be ported to a different os as base.


[ISTIO](https://github.com/fabric8-hdd/fabric8-hypothesis-documentation/blob/master/Istio.asciidoc): This document provides an overview of istio along with its capabilities, installation/deployment procedure and is also intended to capture any future observations or findings from POCs relevant to Hypothesis stack. This is of importance to Hypothesis stack from the perspective of custom metrics addition and filtering capabilities enabled by ISTIO and required by Hypothesis stack.
